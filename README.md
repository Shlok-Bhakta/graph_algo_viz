I have an exam in CS 411 for my uni where I will be answering questions on graph algorithms. Some of these are still a bit fuzzy to me on a lower level so I wanted to learn by making a cool project to visualize these algorithms on real graph data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84)
